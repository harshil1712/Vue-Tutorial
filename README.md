# Vue-Tutorial

## Installing Vue
There are various methods to install vue in your project. Here I am using CDN.

`<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"></script>`

## Data and Method
We can directly call the data from the app.js file into the DOM.
To dispaly a string `<h1>{{dataKey}}</h1>`.
Instead of `h1` tag other header tags, and even `p` tag can be used.
